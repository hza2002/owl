# Owl
**Owl**, an acronym for **Orthogonal Wireless Layout**, combines the ergonomic freedom of wireless connectivity with a split keyboard design influenced by [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58), [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) and [Torn](https://github.com/rtitmuss/torn) keyboards.

## Feature
- Owl uses **Pro Micro** Interconnect small controller board, which means easy for Maintenance and replacemen. And supports a variety of boards including [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano) and [nrfmicro](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/) (I **have not tried yet**, but theoretically feasible).
- Low latency wireless, supported by [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk).
- Gorgeous **RGB** lighting effects.
- Two multifunctional **OLED** screens that can display keyboard battery level and connection status.
- Split keyboard conforms to **ergonomics**.
- A total of two PCBs compatible with Cherry MX switches, Kailh choc Low Profile switches, and Gateron Low Profile switches.
- **Double-sided** PCB design, both sides are universal.

Please make sure you can get the ability to build the keyboard:
- Soldering circuit components
- Circuit board production
- 3D printing
- Using GitHub action to build firmware
- Consulting documents carefully

## Thanks
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the creators and contributors of various articles, repositories, and tutorials that greatly contributed to the development of the 'Owl' keyboard. 

These resources provided me with essential insights and knowledge throughout the development process. I am truly thankful for the open-source community's generosity and collaborative spirit."

Without their invaluable resources, this project would not have been possible. I encourage anyone interested in the details of this project to explore the following sources:

### Other Keyboard
I took inspiration from other keyboards I'd used or liked:
- [Torn](https://github.com/rtitmuss/torn) My first DIY keyboard, easy to build and robust to use. The reason of the Owl keyboard layout (basicly the same).
- [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) Handsome and technological design, various styles of PCB provide important reference.
- [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) Referenced some circuit design and component selection.
- [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) Referenced some circuit design and component selection.
### helpful repo
- [key-switches.pretty](https://github.com/siderakb/key-switches.pretty) Very helpful. It contains various keyboard footprints and has exquisite instruction tables.
